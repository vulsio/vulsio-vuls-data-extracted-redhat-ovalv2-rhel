				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in zstd. While the final file mode is reflective of the input file, when compressing or uncompressing, the file can temporarily gain greater permissions than the input and potentially leading to security issues (especially if large files are being handled). \n            STATEMENT: In OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) the zstd package was delivered in OCP 4.3 which is already end of life.\n\nThis vulnerability can be considered low severity rather than moderate due to the fact that the elevated file permissions are only temporary and only exist during the compression or decompression process. Once the operation completes, the file permissions revert to their intended state, mirroring those of the input file. The risk is further minimized by the fact that the exposure window is brief, and the elevated permissions are not persistent. Additionally, the issue only arises during the processing of files, and only those with larger sizes or more involved operations would be at risk.",
