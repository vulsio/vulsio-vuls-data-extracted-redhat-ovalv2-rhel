				"title": "openssl: double free after calling PEM_read_bio_ex (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A double-free vulnerability was found in OpenSSL's PEM_read_bio_ex function. The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the \"name\" (for example, \"CERTIFICATE\"), any header data, and the payload data. If the function succeeds, then the \"name_out,\" \"header,\" and \"data\" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. Constructing a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data is possible. In this case, PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a freed buffer. A double-free will occur if the caller also frees this buffer. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who can supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw is rated as having a Moderate impact as it is less easily exploited and is only vulnerable in unlikely configurations. Additionally, the upstream advisory (linked in External References) also rates it as Moderate.\n\nThe versions of `shim` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 are shipping OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, which do not contain the incorrect code, so those are not affected by this CVE.",
