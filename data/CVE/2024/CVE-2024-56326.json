				"title": "jinja2: Jinja has a sandbox breakout through indirect reference to format method (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Jinja package. In affected versions of Jinja, an oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications that execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, storing a reference to a malicious string's format method is possible, then passing that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built into Jinja but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is rated as Moderate due to an oversight in Jinja's sandbox environment, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary Python code through controlled template content. This requires control over template content, making exploitation possible only in specific applications, thus limiting its overall impact.",
