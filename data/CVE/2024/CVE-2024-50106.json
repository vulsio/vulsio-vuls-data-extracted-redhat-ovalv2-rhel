The issue requires precise timing between these operations to trigger, which reduces the likelihood of exploitation under normal conditions. Additionally, the vulnerability does not directly expose the system to remote code execution or privilege escalation but instead risks memory corruption or unexpected behavior in NFS delegation handling.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
