				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in OpenSSL's RFC7250 Raw Public Key (RPK) authentication. This vulnerability allows man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks via failure to abort TLS/DTLS handshakes when the server's RPK does not match the expected key despite the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode being set. \n            STATEMENT: The version of OpenSSL in RHEL-9.5 is affected by this vulnerability. However, earlier releases of OpenSSL in RHEL are not affected. This issue was introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.\n\nRPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers. The issue only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server, and the server, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate chain. The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to fail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys, by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER. \n\nClients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result(), and those that do, and take appropriate action, are not affected.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
