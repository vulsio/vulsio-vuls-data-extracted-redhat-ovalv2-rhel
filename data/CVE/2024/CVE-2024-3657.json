				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in 389-ds-base. A specially-crafted LDAP query can potentially cause a failure on the directory server, leading to a denial of service \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is categorized as an important severity issue rather than a critical one because, while it can cause a denial of service by stopping the directory service, it does not allow for remote code execution, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration. The impact is limited to service disruption, which can be mitigated by monitoring and automatic service restarts. Additionally, exploiting this vulnerability requires specific crafted packets, indicating that an attacker would need a certain level of knowledge and access to execute the attack, reducing the likelihood of widespread exploitation.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
