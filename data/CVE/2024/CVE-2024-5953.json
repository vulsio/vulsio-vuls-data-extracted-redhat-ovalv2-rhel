				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A denial of service vulnerability was found in the 389-ds-base LDAP server. This issue may allow an authenticated user to cause a server denial of service while attempting to log in with a user with a malformed hash in their password. \n            STATEMENT: LDAP servers are not usually exposed to the open internet, requiring adjacent connectivity for a successful attack. This issue also requires a compromised user account to perform the attack. Therefore, this flaw is rated as a Moderate severity.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
