				"title": "screen: allows sending SIGHUP to arbitrary PIDs (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in screen. This flaw allows local users to send a SIGHUP signal to any PID due to a missing signal sending permission check, potentially resulting in a denial of service or disruption of the target process. \n            STATEMENT: The screen binary as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux is installed with the set-group-ID mode bit set. However, the binary's group is set to screen and not root, limiting the security impact of this issue.\nThe screen package is not shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9. Therefore, these versions of RHEL are not affected by this flaw and are not listed in the Affected Packages list below.",
