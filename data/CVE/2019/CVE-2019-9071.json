				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The CVE program describes this issue as: An issue was discovered in GNU libiberty, as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.32. It is a stack consumption issue in d_count_templates_scopes in cp-demangle.c after many recursive calls. \n            STATEMENT: The issue is classified as low severity primarily because binutils is not typically exposed to untrusted inputs in most environments, limiting its exploitation potential. The buffer overflow in d_expression_1() only triggers during the parsing of malformed ELF files, which would require an attacker to convince a user to process a malicious ELF file with readelf. Moreover, binutils does not handle privileged operations, meaning exploitation is unlikely to lead to system compromise or escalation of privileges. Additionally, the impact is localized to the application itself, without affecting the broader system or network security.",
